XMLBurger - In Development

XMLBurger is a tool to convert XML documents into Java Objects.
It is fast and suitable for large documents (Stax), specially XML documents with a strange structure, where XPaths are not really efficients as they have to be invocated too many times.
Perfectly suitable for research purpose and specially for XMLs coming from biomedical repositories.
